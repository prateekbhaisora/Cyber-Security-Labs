# Buffer Overflow Lab

This repository contains code for exploiting `Buffer Overflow` vulnerabilities on `x86_64` systems. The directory structure is as follows:

* **01-os-coa:** This directory contains code for demonstrating various programming, operating systems and computer architecture concepts required to understand buffer overflows.

* **02-asm:** This directory contains code for demonstrating `x86_32` and `x86_64` assembly. It also contains slides from the `COL334` course at IIT Delhi, by `Prof. Abhilash Jindal`, to explain various concepts of `x86_32` assembly. 

* **03-bo:** This directory contains code for demonstrating basic buffer overflow attacks.

* **04-sh:** This directory contains code for demonstrating injection of shellcode into an executable stack, leading to an invocation of shell prompt, in `x86_64` systems.

* **05-rop:** This directory contains code for demonstrating `Return-to-libc` and `Return-Oriented programming` in `x86_64` systems.

* **06-def:** This directory contains code for demonstrating various defence mechanisms against buffer overflow attacks in x86_64 systems such as `Stack Canaries`, `W^X` bit, `Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)`.

* **07-other:** This directory contains a simple text file that comprises of various `commands` used during demonstation of this lab.
